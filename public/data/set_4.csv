B: I understand where you're coming from, but I believe that men, especially fathers, should have a say too. It's not just about the woman's body; it's also about the potential life of the child and the father's role in that.

A: I get that it's a complex issue, but ultimately, the physical and emotional burden falls on the woman. As a man, the only body I should have a say in is my own. Men can offer support and share their perspectives, but the final decision should rest with the woman.

B: I understand your concern, A. It's a complex issue, and the implications can be far-reaching. But don't you think there are safeguards in place to prevent such a slippery slope? Each issue, like abortion and elder care, has its own set of ethical considerations and protections.
