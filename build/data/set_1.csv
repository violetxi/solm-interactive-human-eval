B: Yeah, I've been keeping up with the updates. Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made molecules that can mimic the immune system's ability to fight off harmful pathogens like viruses. They target specific parts of the virus to neutralize it. It's different from vaccines, which train your immune system to recognize and fight the virus if you get exposed in the future.
