B: I understand your concern, A. It's true that social media can sometimes limit discussions to prevent misinformation. However, in the medical community, there are ongoing discussions and studies about the vaccines' impact. The data we've seen so far indicates that the vaccines have significantly reduced severe cases and deaths, even though there are still challenges and areas needing more research.

B: Adverse effects are taken very seriously, and they are continuously monitored. The benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and death far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. As for natural immunity, it does provide protection, but it's less predictable and can come at the cost of severe illness or long-term complications.
