I suggested implementing a more robust matching algorithm that checks for similarities in user data fields like email and phone number.

I'm glad you found my feedback useful. I'm curious to see what changes you've made. Let's go through it together.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Sure, so I've incorporated your suggestion about focusing more on the user experience.

The new format should make it easier to run our queries and visualize the data trends. Let me know if you have any specific questions about the changes.\n\nTurn 2\nB: That makes sense, thanks for clarifying. I did have one question about the new column you added.
