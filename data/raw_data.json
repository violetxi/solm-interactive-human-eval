But I've heard so many stories of people who have been in your shoes and found incredible joy and fulfillment. There are also options like adoption and so much community support available.\n\nTurn 2\nA: I know, but it still feels overwhelming. What if I'm not ready for this responsibility?\nB: It's completely normal to feel that way. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone. Pregnancy is not a crisis. It's a gift. Whether they be wanted by you or someone else, no child is unwanted. There are many people and resources ready to help you every step of the way, no matter what you decide.",

Despite the initial challenges, they grew up in a loving environment and have had such a fulfilling life.\nB: That's really touching to hear. I guess it's true that sometimes unexpected situations can turn out better than we anticipate. It's just hard to know what the right decision is when you're in the middle of it.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Absolutely, and every situation is unique. But seeing how my friend's life turned out, it makes me think about the potential each life holds, even if it starts out unplanned. I was an accidental baby and as far as I know, my parents were happy to have me.\nB: I appreciate you sharing that. It gives me a lot to think about, especially with everything going on in my family right now. It's comforting to consider the positive possibilities.",
