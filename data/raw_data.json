There are so many resources in wealthier countries, yet people are still suffering so much. Why isn't more being done to help?\n\nB: I know what you mean. It feels like there's a huge disconnect. Sometimes it seems like the political and logistical barriers are just too overwhelming, but it's hard to accept that as an excuse when lives are at stake.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Exactly. It makes me wonder if people are just turning a blind eye because it's not happening in their backyard. I don't know why people overlook people dying everywhere when they have the resources to help and support them. But how can we be okay with that? We have the means to make a difference.\n\nB: It's a tough reality. I think part of the problem is that people feel powerless or unsure of how to help. Maybe if there were more awareness and clearer ways to contribute, more people would get involved. We need to find ways to bridge that gap.",
