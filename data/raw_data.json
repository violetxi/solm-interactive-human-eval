I'm a lot like Jonathan Creek, really, only without the intelligence. Or the good looks, or the charm\nB: Oh, come on! You remind me of that clever and charming character from that show we both love. You're always so witty and engaging.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Ha, I wish! If only I had half their charisma. I just feel like I'm always fumbling my way through conversations.\nB: Well, that's what makes you endearing. Your authenticity and humor are what people love about you.

It's like they're living in an alternate reality where facts don't matter. Boris Johnson is entirely trustworthy and honest and there was obviously no Christmas Party in Number 10 this time last year",
