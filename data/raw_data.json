There are often alternatives that can be considered.\n\nTurn 2\nA: But what if those alternatives aren't viable? Sometimes, the reality is that the only option to save the mother's life is to terminate the pregnancy.\nB: It's a difficult situation, no doubt. However, I think we need to focus on improving medical care and support systems to minimize such scenarios, rather than making abortion the default solution. Who defends murder here?
