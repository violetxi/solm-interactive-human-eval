We use a combination of formative and summative assessments. Formative assessments include quizzes, class participation, and homework, which help us gauge ongoing understanding. Summative assessments, like end-of-term exams and projects, evaluate the students' overall grasp of the material.\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense. Right. The mantra at my school is that we don't give grades, kids earn them. How do you ensure that the grades reflect both the students' efforts and their actual performance?\n\nB: We have a balanced approach. Effort is recognized through participation and homework grades, while performance is measured through tests and projects. Additionally, we provide feedback throughout the term to help students improve continuously, ensuring their grades reflect both their hard work and their mastery of the subject.",

SEC refs are bad CBB refs are bad It's like they were blind to all the fouls!\nB: Yeah, it was pretty frustrating to watch. The officiating in the SEC has been terrible this season. It's like they don't even care about getting it right.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Exactly! And it's not just this game. It feels like every week there's some controversy because of the refs. It's ruining the sport for me.\nB: I hear you. They really need to do something about it. Maybe bring in some new officials or improve their training. College basketball deserves better.",

It was like every day I walked into that building, I was just waiting for the next insult or prank. I was teased for being a virgin when I was a 6th grader- in 2005 It really messed with my self-esteem for a long time.\nB: I totally get that. In middle school, I was teased a lot for my weight. It was so personal and hurtful. I felt like I couldn't escape it, and it made me so self-conscious. Even now, I sometimes hear those voices in my head.\n\nTurn 2\nA: It's crazy how those experiences stick with us, isn't it? I mean, logically, I know those bullies were just projecting their own insecurities, but emotionally, it's a different story. It took me years to start believing in myself again.\nB: Absolutely. It's like those moments become a part of us. But talking about it now, with you, makes me feel less alone. It's comforting to know that someone else understands what it was like and how it still affects us today.",

We use a combination of formative and summative assessments. Formative assessments include quizzes, class participation, and homework, which help us gauge ongoing understanding. Summative assessments, like end-of-term exams and projects, evaluate the students' overall grasp of the material.\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense. Right. The mantra at my school is that we don't give grades, kids earn them. How do you ensure that the grades reflect both the students' efforts and their actual performance?\n\nB: We have a balanced approach. Effort is recognized through participation and homework grades, while performance is measured through tests and projects. Additionally, we provide feedback throughout the term to help students improve continuously, ensuring their grades reflect both their hard work and their mastery of the subject.",

Do you think it will really make a difference, though?\n\nTurn 2\nA: Absolutely. When officers are more engaged with the community, it creates a sense of partnership.
