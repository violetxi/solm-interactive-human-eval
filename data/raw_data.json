How do you reconcile the existence of so much suffering in the world with the idea of a benevolent God?\n\nB: It's definitely a tough question. I think some people argue that suffering is a necessary part of free will or that it serves a greater purpose we can't fully understand. Personally, I don't subscribe to any religious beliefs, but I find those perspectives interesting to consider.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Right, the free will defense is a common one. I have no faith, but the theodicy problem has multiple answers, I'm not too concerned with it. But then, it raises more questions, like why an omnipotent being couldn't create a world where free will exists without so much suffering. It's a bit of a philosophical rabbit hole.\n\nB: Absolutely, and it seems like every answer just leads to more questions. Maybe that's why these debates have persisted for centuries.
