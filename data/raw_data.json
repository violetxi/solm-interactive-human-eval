I've been trying to revert some persistent vandalism but seem to be having trouble getting it right. Could you advise me on the best way to handle this?\n\nB: No problem, A. I appreciate your efforts to keep the page clean. When reverting vandalism, it's best to use the \"undo\" function for each specific change. If the vandalism is extensive, you might want to revert to a previous clean version of the page. Does that help?\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense, thanks. I got the page fixed. Sorry I had to do it several times on the page but it wouldn't let me revert it to before the IP user vandalized it how do you do that?I was worried about losing any legitimate edits in the process. Is there a way to ensure I don't accidentally remove any good contributions?\n\nB: Yes, you can compare the versions before reverting to make sure no valid edits are lost. Also, consider leaving a note in the edit summary explaining the reason for the revert. If you're still unsure, feel free to ask for a second opinion before making the changes.",

Are there different rules for self-created images versus those we source from elsewhere?\n\nB: Hi A! Yes, there are different rules.

So, if I create an image myself, do I need to add any specific tags or information when uploading it?\n\nB: Yes, when you upload a self-created image, you should tag it as \"self-created\" and include a brief description.

I appreciate your efforts to keep the page clean. When reverting vandalism, it's best to use the \"undo\" function for each specific change. If the vandalism is extensive, you might want to revert to a previous clean version of the page. Does that help?\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense, thanks. I got the page fixed.

Are there different rules for self-created images versus those we source from elsewhere?\n\nB: Hi A! Yes, there are different rules.

For sourced images, you need to ensure they are either in the public domain or have a compatible license, and you must provide proper attribution.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Got it, thanks!

So, if I create an image myself, do I need to add any specific tags or information when uploading it?\n\nB: Yes, when you upload a self-created image, you should tag it as \"self-created\" and include a brief description.

I appreciate your efforts to keep the page clean. When reverting vandalism, it's best to use the \"undo\" function for each specific change. If the vandalism is extensive, you might want to revert to a previous clean version of the page. Does that help?\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense, thanks. I got the page fixed.

Im asking if you can help make it since i saw you made WikiProject Dam? Could you help me out?\n\nB: Hi A! Sure, I'd be happy to help. For banners, you'll want to use a simple, recognizable design that represents your task force's focus. As for quality charts, it's important to set clear criteria for each quality level. Do you have any specific ideas or examples you're working with?\n\nTurn 2\nA: Thanks, B! I was thinking of using a color scheme that matches our main project and incorporating an icon related to our topic. For the quality charts, I'm not sure where to start with the criteria. Any tips on what to include?\n\nB: That sounds like a great start for the banner. For the quality charts, consider including criteria like article completeness, sourcing, formatting, and neutrality.

I've been trying to revert some persistent vandalism but seem to be having trouble getting it right. Could you advise me on the best way to handle this?\n\nB: No problem, A. I appreciate your efforts to keep the page clean. When reverting vandalism, it's best to use the \"undo\" function for each specific change. If the vandalism is extensive, you might want to revert to a previous clean version of the page. Does that help?\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense, thanks. I got the page fixed. Sorry I had to do it several times on the page but it wouldn't let me revert it to before the IP user vandalized it how do you do that?I was worried about losing any legitimate edits in the process. Is there a way to ensure I don't accidentally remove any good contributions?\n\nB: Yes, you can compare the versions before reverting to make sure no valid edits are lost. Also, consider leaving a note in the edit summary explaining the reason for the revert. If you're still unsure, feel free to ask for a second opinion before making the changes.",

Are there different rules for self-created images versus those we source from elsewhere?\n\nB: Hi A! Yes, there are different rules. Self-created images are generally easier to use because you own the rights. For sourced images, you need to ensure they are either in the public domain or have a compatible license, and you must provide proper attribution.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Got it, thanks! I hope I don't upset anyone by jumping in univited, but why are self-created images any different than those found elsewhere so long as they comply with all of the non-free content criteria? Is this caveat hiding in a talk page archive somewhere? So, if I create an image myself, do I need to add any specific tags or information when uploading it?\n\nB: Yes, when you upload a self-created image, you should tag it as \"self-created\" and include a brief description.

Are there different rules for self-created images versus those we source from elsewhere?\n\nB: Hi A! Yes, there are different rules.

For sourced images, you need to ensure they are either in the public domain or have a compatible license, and you must provide proper attribution.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Got it, thanks!

I appreciate your efforts to keep the page clean. When reverting vandalism, it's best to use the \"undo\" function for each specific change.
