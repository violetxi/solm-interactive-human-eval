At this stage, the baby already has a heartbeat and is starting to develop its own unique features.Hey Megan--a baby's heart starts beating at 21 days after conception. No time is the right time to end its life!!\nB: I understand, Alex, and I appreciate your concern. But I'm really scared and unsure if I'm ready to bring a child into this world right now. There are so many factors to consider.\n\nTurn 2\nA: I get that, Megan. It's a huge decision. But maybe there's a way to find support and resources that can help you through this. You don't have to go through it alone.\nB: I know you're trying to help, and I value our friendship so much. I just need some time to think and weigh all my options carefully.

RT \"It seems to me clear as daylight that abortion would be a crime.\" -Ghandi He once said, \"It seems to me as clear as daylight that abortion would be a crime.\" His perspective really resonates with me because it emphasizes the sanctity of life from the moment of conception.\n\nB: That's an interesting point, A. I can see why Gandhi's views might be compelling. But what about situations where the mother's life is at risk or in cases of severe fetal abnormalities? How do you reconcile those circumstances with your stance?\n\nTurn 2\nA: Those are definitely challenging situations, and I don't take them lightly. I believe that every life has intrinsic value, but I also understand the complexities involved. In such cases, I think it's crucial to weigh the moral implications carefully and consider all possible alternatives before making a decision.\n\nB: I appreciate your thoughtful approach, A. It's clear that this is a deeply nuanced issue. I'm still trying to form my own opinion, but hearing your perspective helps me see the ethical considerations more clearly.",

Every human person - is a being of inestimable worth created in the image and likeness of God. -St. JPII St. John Paul II emphasized that life is a gift from God, and we have a duty to protect it.\nB: I understand where you're coming from, but I think it's important to consider the rights and autonomy of the woman as well. For many, the decision to have an abortion is deeply personal and can be influenced by a variety of complex factors.\n\nTurn 2\nA: I agree that the situation is complex and that women face difficult choices. However, I feel that the potential life of the unborn child also deserves consideration and protection. It's about finding a balance that respects both lives.\nB: I see your point, but I believe that prioritizing the woman's right to make decisions about her own body is crucial. It's about trusting women to make the best choices for themselves and their circumstances.",

Very \" uh?\nB: While I understand your concern, we must also consider the lives of the unborn. There are alternatives like adoption that can provide a solution without ending a life.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Adoption is not a simple fix. It doesn't address the immediate health risks and socio-economic challenges that many women face. We need to prioritize their safety and autonomy.\nB: I agree that women's health is important, but we should also work towards creating a society where both the mother and the child are supported, rather than resorting to abortion as the first option.",
