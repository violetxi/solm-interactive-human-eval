I was just wondering, is it really fair to delete an unintentional duplication of a deleted category without a formal CFD submission? Could you shed some light on this?\n\nB: Hi A, I understand your concern. Generally, if a category has been previously deleted for being redundant or not fitting our guidelines, re-creating it without significant changes can lead to it being removed again. However, if you believe there was a mistake or the context has changed, we can definitely review it more formally.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Thanks for explaining, B. I wasn't aware of the previous deletion, but I think the context might have changed since then. Should I submit a request for a formal review, or is there another way to address this?\n\nB: If you believe the context has indeed changed, submitting a request for a formal review is the best approach.

I just read through it, and it looks pretty thorough. I do have a question about the second step where you mention the data normalization process. Could you elaborate a bit more on that?\n\nTurn 2\nA: Sure, no problem. In the second step, the data normalization involves scaling the input features to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1.

As for edit summaries, it's good to be clear and concise. Mention why you're reverting, like \"reverting vandalism\" or \"undoing unsourced changes.\"\n\nTurn 2\nA: Thanks, B! That makes sense.

Could you shed some light on this?\n\nB: Hi A, I understand your concern. Generally, if a category has been previously deleted for being redundant or not fitting our guidelines, re-creating it without significant changes can lead to it being removed again. However, if you believe there was a mistake or the context has changed, we can definitely review it more formally.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Thanks for explaining, B.

As for edit summaries, it's good to be clear and concise. Mention why you're reverting, like \"reverting vandalism\" or \"undoing unsourced changes.\"\n\nTurn 2\nA: Thanks, B! That makes sense. Hi, I'm new to RC patrol, and I was wondering how you do the 'reverted edits by X to version by Y' edit summary. Is there a shortcut to reverting an edit?

I usually start by looking at edits from new or unregistered users, as they tend to need more scrutiny. Also, using tools like Huggle or Twinkle can help speed up the process.

I can start working on that and also compile a comprehensive list of all current convoys.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Perfect. Your organizational skills will be invaluable for this task.

As for edit summaries, it's good to be clear and concise. Mention why you're reverting, like \"reverting vandalism\" or \"undoing unsourced changes.\"\n\nTurn 2\nA: Thanks, B! That makes sense.
