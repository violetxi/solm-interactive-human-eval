Each issue, like abortion and elder care, has its own set of ethical considerations and protections.\n\nTurn 2\nA: I get that there are supposed to be safeguards, but history has shown that once we start down a path of devaluing certain lives, it can be a very slippery slope.

It's a real fear for me.\nB: That's a valid point, and history does offer some cautionary tales.

If we start devaluing life at its earliest stages, what's to stop society from extending that devaluation to other vulnerable groups, like the elderly?\nB: I understand your concern, A. It's a complex issue, and the implications can be far-reaching. But don't you think there are safeguards in place to prevent such a slippery slope? Each issue, like abortion and elder care, has its own set of ethical considerations and protections.\n\nTurn 2\nA: I get that there are supposed to be safeguards, but history has shown that once we start down a path of devaluing certain lives, it can be a very slippery slope. I'm kind of scared for the elderly in our country. In a few years, we'll be aborting them too. Look at how some societies have treated their elderly in the past. It's a real fear for me.\nB: That's a valid point, and history does offer some cautionary tales. Maybe the key is to ensure that we have strong, clear ethical guidelines and robust protections in place for all vulnerable groups, so that one issue doesn't lead to another.",
