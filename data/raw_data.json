But why do you think there's so much skepticism despite the evidence showing the vaccine's effectiveness?\n\nTurn 2\nA: Part of it is the sheer volume of information, and misinformation, that's so easily accessible now.

In my experience at the hospital, though, I've seen firsthand how effective the vaccine is in preventing severe illness and keeping people out of the ICU.\n\nB: I guess seeing those real-life outcomes would make a big difference.

What are your thoughts on the fact that world data for basically every country shows a massive sustained increase in deaths starting at the exact time the spike protein inducing mRNA vaccines were introduced? I've yet to find 1 doctor on Twitter who will address this... What do you think about that?\n\nB: I understand your concerns, A. There's a lot of information out there, and it can be overwhelming. As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety. The reports you're referring to often lack context and can be misleading. The benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and death far outweigh the risks.\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense, but it's still a bit unsettling to hear those kinds of reports. How do we know for sure that the vaccines are safe in the long term?\n\nB: It's a valid question. Long-term safety is continuously monitored through various systems and studies. So far, the data shows that the vaccines are not only effective but also safe over the long term. The rigorous approval process and ongoing surveillance are designed to catch any potential issues early. It's important to rely on credible sources and scientific evidence when evaluating such information.",

As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety.

As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety. The reports you're referring to often lack context and can be misleading.

As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety. The reports you're referring to often lack context and can be misleading.

As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety. The reports you're referring to often lack context and can be misleading. The benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and death far outweigh the risks.\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense, but it's still a bit unsettling to hear those kinds of reports. How do we know for sure that the vaccines are safe in the long term?\n\nB: It's a valid question. Long-term safety is continuously monitored through various systems and studies. So far, the data shows that the vaccines are not only effective but also safe over the long term. The rigorous approval process and ongoing surveillance are designed to catch any potential issues early. It's important to rely on credible sources and scientific evidence when evaluating such information.",

I've yet to find 1 doctor on Twitter who will address this... What do you think about that?\n\nB: I understand your concerns, A. There's a lot of information out there, and it can be overwhelming. As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety. The reports you're referring to often lack context and can be misleading. The benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and death far outweigh the risks.\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense, but it's still a bit unsettling to hear those kinds of reports. How do we know for sure that the vaccines are safe in the long term?\n\nB: It's a valid question. Long-term safety is continuously monitored through various systems and studies. So far, the data shows that the vaccines are not only effective but also safe over the long term. The rigorous approval process and ongoing surveillance are designed to catch any potential issues early.

With polio, it took years of research and trials before it was widely available.

But why do you think there's so much skepticism despite the evidence showing the vaccine's effectiveness?\n\nTurn 2\nA: Part of it is the sheer volume of information, and misinformation, that's so easily accessible now. Social media can amplify doubts and spread false claims quickly. In my experience at the hospital, though, I've seen firsthand how effective the vaccine is in preventing severe illness and keeping people out of the ICU.\n\nB: I guess seeing those real-life outcomes would make a big difference. It's just hard to sift through all the noise sometimes.It's because the polio vaccine actually works. That's why there was no skepticism unlike today.

As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety. The reports you're referring to often lack context and can be misleading.

As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety. The reports you're referring to often lack context and can be misleading.

As someone who's been involved in the vaccination campaign, I can tell you that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and monitored for safety. The reports you're referring to often lack context and can be misleading. The benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and death far outweigh the risks.\n\nTurn 2\nA: That makes sense, but it's still a bit unsettling to hear those kinds of reports. How do we know for sure that the vaccines are safe in the long term?\n\nB: It's a valid question. Long-term safety is continuously monitored through various systems and studies. So far, the data shows that the vaccines are not only effective but also safe over the long term. The rigorous approval process and ongoing surveillance are designed to catch any potential issues early. It's important to rely on credible sources and scientific evidence when evaluating such information.",
