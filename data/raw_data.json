Maybe we should start by advocating for more progressive taxation and better access to education and healthcare. Those could be game-changers for so many people.",

I absolutely loveee not getting a graduation ceremony after I spent 3 years on my degree and ended up over £50,000 in debt\nB: Yeah, it's really disappointing. I was looking forward to celebrating with everyone. But I guess they had no choice with everything going on.\n\nTurn 2\nA: Still, it feels like a slap in the face. We put in so much effort, and now we don't even get to walk across the stage.\nB: I get it. It's frustrating. Maybe we can plan our own little celebration? It won't be the same, but at least we can mark the occasion somehow.",

Maybe he's just going through a rough patch. It happens to the best of them.\n\nTurn 2\nA: I hope you're right. We really need him to step up if we're going to make a serious run this season.\nB: Absolutely. Maybe a bit of rest or a change in tactics could help him get back on track. Let's hope the coach has a plan.",
