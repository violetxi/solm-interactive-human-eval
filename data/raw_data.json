It's empowering to make smart financial decisions and watch them pay off.\nB: That sounds fascinating! I'm new to the whole concept of investing. How exactly can it change one's financial trajectory?\n\nTurn 2\nA: Well, by investing wisely, you can accumulate wealth over time, which can significantly improve your financial stability and independence. But a worker who earns wealth can invest it and become a capital investor. In that case he is literally providing the capital. It's all about making informed choices and being patient.\nB: I see.
