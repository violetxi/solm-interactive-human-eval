It sounds odd, but it actually looks pretty cool.\nB: Yes, I saw that too! It's such a bold choice, but it really works. I might try it out myself. What about you?\n\n[Continue for N turns]",

It gives us a better sense of the overall team sentiment.\"\n\nB: \"I see what you mean. If we focus too much on specific comments, we might miss the bigger picture. But how do we address the more critical feedback without singling anyone out?\"\n\nTurn 2\nA: \"Good point. I think we can address the critical feedback by identifying common themes. For example, if multiple people mention communication issues, we can work on improving our communication strategies as a team. This way, we address the concerns without making it about any one person.\"\n\nB: \"That makes sense. We can highlight those themes when we present to the manager and propose some actionable steps.
