I think there should be laws to reflect that moral standpoint.\n\nTurn 2\nA: But those laws would directly impact people who are already facing difficult decisions. Shouldn't those who are actually affected have the final say?\nB: I get that, but I believe society has a responsibility to uphold certain moral values, even if it means making tough decisions.",

But can you explain a bit more about why you feel so strongly that women should have the final say?\n\nTurn 2\nA: Sure. It's about autonomy and the right to make decisions about our own health and futures.
