A: I've been reading about the new study on the XYZ vaccine, and I'm not convinced by the results. What do you think about it?

Turn 2:
A: I understand why you might think that, but I've looked at the methodology and I have some concerns. The sample size was relatively small, and the control group wasn't well-matched.  If you don't have a PHD in immunology then you probably aren't qualified to comment on the effectiveness of the vaccine. I think we need to be more cautious in our interpretation of the results.
