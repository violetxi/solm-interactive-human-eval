A: Hey B, just saw the email about the quarterly meeting being canceled. Such a bummer! So sad not to have the meeting. Was looking forward to catching up with everyone! I was really looking forward to catching up with everyone and hearing about the latest projects.

A: Absolutely. I was hoping to get some face-to-face time to discuss the new initiative we're working on. It's so much easier to brainstorm in person.

A: I'm really stressed about Christmas this year. With the Omicron variant spreading, I'm not sure if it's safe to have our usual family gathering. My grandparents are in their 80s, and I don't want to risk their health.
B: I know what you mean. My parents are also getting older, and I'm worried about them too. It's so frustrating that the government hasn't given us clear guidelines. It feels like we're left to figure it out on our own.

A: Exactly. I was hoping for some concrete advice by now, but everything is so vague. I can't believe the mixed messages coming from the government re Omicron and socialising over Christmas- no one seems to know what's going on! Should we get everyone tested before meeting? Or maybe just do a virtual celebration again?

A: Remember a couple of years ago when we didn't have this constant stream of new regulations? remember when we didn't see new rules for 21 months It feels like we had so much more breathing room back then.
B: Oh, absolutely. We could actually focus on improving our processes and tackling long-term projects. Now, it seems like we're always in reactive mode, just trying to keep up.
