A: I know it's tough with the group splitting up, but I think I'm going to support both the remaining members and the one who left. i've made up mind. i'm gonna support both ot8 and Jessica equally. maybe the split is required to save their friendship. you may never know.

B: I get where you're coming from, but it's hard for me to support the one who left. It feels like a betrayal to the group and to us as fans. How do you manage to stay neutral?
