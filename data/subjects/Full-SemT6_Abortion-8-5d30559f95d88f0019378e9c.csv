A: I saw that article too. It's definitely a complex issue. Personally, I think we should focus more on supporting women with unplanned pregnancies through better resources and counseling. There are many alternatives that can be beneficial for both the mother and the child. I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. Abortion is not 'medical help' & there are better options.

A: Well, things like comprehensive prenatal care, adoption services, and financial assistance could really help. If we invest in these areas, we might be able to offer more viable options for women who feel like they have no other choice.
