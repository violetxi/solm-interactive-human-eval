A: I understand where you're coming from. It's definitely a complex issue with a lot of emotional and ethical layers. Abortion is on the wrong side of history: healers, inventors, artists, your wife, your husband, your best friend, all eliminated. I think it's important to consider all perspectives and the individual circumstances involved.
B: Absolutely. I appreciate you listening and being open to my viewpoint. It's not always easy to have these conversations, but I think they're really important.","Abortion is on the wrong side of history: healers, inventors, artists, your wife, your husband, your best friend, all eliminated.",against

A: I understand that everyone has their own views, but I really believe that abortion shouldn't be seen as a form of medical assistance. There are so many other options, like adoption or support services, that can be explored instead.. I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. Abortion is not 'medical help' & there are better options.

A: I really feel that our efforts to protect children's rights are incomplete if we don't address the issue of abortion. We are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty.... - Yet abortion is still legal.
