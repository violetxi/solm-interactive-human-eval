A: I was watching this debate the other day about COVID-19 vaccine mandates. One person was saying they're necessary to keep the healthcare system from getting overwhelmed.

A: I've been wondering, with so many people vaccinated now, how effective have the government interventions been in controlling COVID-19 cases?
