A: Hey B, I realized I might have missed some of your suggestions about handling duplicate user profiles. Can we go over them again? I want to make sure we're on the same page and improve our system.

B: Of course, A. No problem at all. I suggested implementing a more robust matching algorithm that checks for similarities in user data fields like email and phone number. This should help us identify duplicates more accurately.

A: That makes sense. Thanks, I didn't notice the earlier discussion. Would you consider (if you haven't done so yet) adding some indication on either page that these are the same user? Do you think we should also add a manual review step for cases where the algorithm isn't certain?

B: Hey A, I noticed the image of the early computer prototype you shared is missing from our project folder. Could you re-upload it when you get a chance?

A: Hey B, how's your latest project coming along?
B: It's going well, thanks. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something I noticed in the database. Do you have a moment?

A: Sure, what's up?
B: I came across an image that might need a slight update to ensure it accurately represents the specific enantiomer. The proper title of this image should be Eszopiclone.svg, since it depicts the S enantiomer. Could you change the title so I can upload an image of the racemic compound instead? Could we take a look at it together?

B: Hi A, I noticed you made some changes to the structure of the data table. Could you explain the reasoning behind it? I want to make sure I understand the modifications fully.

A: Sure, B! I restructured the table to better align with our analysis goals. The new format should make it easier to run our queries and visualize the data trends. Let me know if you have any specific questions about the changes.

B: That makes sense, thanks for clarifying. I did have one question about the new column you added. How does it fit into our current analysis framework?I'm interested in why you reduced the columns from 5 to 2? Could you reply on my talk page please?
