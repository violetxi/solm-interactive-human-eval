A: You're entitled to your opinion, I respect that. 2 days ago I knew 5 vaccine injured people in a close circle, today I know 6, 3 of which have this injury for the rest of their lives. In my opinion this is not normal. Risks are even listed on FDA site. I stand by what I say. 
B: I get that you're worried, but it's important to look at the bigger picture. Vaccines have saved countless lives and helped us get closer to ending the pandemic.","You're entitled to your opinion, I respect that. 2 days ago I knew 5 vaccine injured people in a close circle, today I know 6, 3 of which have this injury for the rest of their lives.
