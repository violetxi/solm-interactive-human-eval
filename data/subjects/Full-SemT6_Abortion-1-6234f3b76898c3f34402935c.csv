A: I understand you want to support women's health services, and I respect that. But for me, Planned Parenthood's involvement in abortions is something I can't reconcile with my beliefs about the sanctity of life. I truly believe that and that's why I'm against Planned Parenthood.
B: I get where you're coming from, and I appreciate you sharing your perspective. For me, it's about providing comprehensive care and support to women, especially those who might not have other options.

A: I just can't believe we're still fighting for basic reproductive rights in this day and age. It's infuriating to see these proposals trying to take us backward.

A: Exactly! I cannot believe there are still people in this century who opposed to women having rights over their own bodies! It's not just about the right to choose, it's about respecting women's autonomy and trusting them to make decisions about their own bodies.
