A: Hi B! I've just started helping out with recent changes patrol, and I'm a bit unsure about the best way to revert edits and what to include in the edit summaries. Do you have any tips?

B: Hey A! Welcome to the team! For reverting edits, you can use the ""undo"" function for simple reverts or the ""rollback"" feature if you have the permissions. As for edit summaries, it's good to be clear and concise. Mention why you're reverting, like ""reverting vandalism"" or ""undoing unsourced changes.""

A: Thanks, B! That makes sense. Hi, I'm new to RC patrol, and I was wondering how you do the 'reverted edits by X to version by Y' edit summary. Is there a shortcut to reverting an edit? Is there a way to quickly identify which edits need reverting, or do you just go through them one by one?

B: Great question! I usually start by looking at edits from new or unregistered users, as they tend to need more scrutiny. Also, using tools like Huggle or Twinkle can help speed up the process. Keep an eye on patterns and trust your instincts. You'll get the hang of it in no time!",Polite,2024-07-26T00:07:52.461000+00:00,"Was the person intended to be polite when they said ""Hi, I'm new to RC patrol, and I was wondering how you do the 'reverted edits by X to version by Y' edit summary.

A: I don't see why you're so upset about the image. It's just a satirical take on the public figure, and it's not like I'm vandalizing anything.Don't threaten me as that is not vandalism. What is wrong with a nude photo of Barack's mom?

A: I've simplified the diagram of my cold fusion setup by omitting some of the less critical components.

A: Hi B, I had a chat with Marskell about how we can manage our daily tasks and ensure coverage when either of us needs to take time off. We came up with a potential solution that I think could work well.

B: Sure, A. I'm definitely interested in hearing what you and Marskell came up with. What's the plan?

Turn 2
A: Great! The idea is to create a shared calendar where we can log our tasks and deadlines. This way, we can easily see what needs to be covered if one of us is out. Marskell suggested we also have a brief daily check-in to update each other on our progress. What do you think?

B: That sounds like a solid plan. I like the idea of the shared calendar and the daily check-ins. It should help us stay on top of things. I'm on board with proposing this to Raul.

A: Hey B, I noticed that a category I created was deleted because it was a duplicate of a previously deleted category. I'm a bit confused about whether this was the right call since there wasn't a formal review process. Hello. I was just wondering, is it really fair to delete an unintentional duplication of a deleted category without a formal CFD submission? Could you shed some light on this?

B: Hi A, I understand your concern. Generally, if a category has been previously deleted for being redundant or not fitting our guidelines, re-creating it without significant changes can lead to it being removed again. However, if you believe there was a mistake or the context has changed, we can definitely review it more formally.

A: Thanks for explaining, B. I wasn't aware of the previous deletion, but I think the context might have changed since then. Should I submit a request for a formal review, or is there another way to address this?
