A: Thanks for explaining the basics of version control and code diffs, B. Thank you for that, I was having a problem with diffs and the explanation didn't make sense to me. This is the first I have had to do, what is the procedure? Could you walk me through a step-by-step procedure for making my first commit and pushing it to the repository?

B: Sure, A. First, make sure you've made your changes in your local working directory. Then, open your terminal and navigate to your project folder. Run `git status` to see the changes you've made. Next, use `git add .` to stage all your changes. After that, commit your changes with `git commit -m ""Your commit message""`. Finally, push your changes to the remote repository with `git push origin your-branch-name`.

Turn 2
A: Got it. So, just to confirm, I should run `git status` to check my changes, `git add .` to stage them, `git commit -m ""message""` to commit, and `git push origin branch-name` to push them. Is there anything else I should be aware of?

B: That's correct! Just make sure your commit message is clear and descriptive. Also, if you're working on a shared branch, it's a good practice to pull the latest changes from the remote repository before pushing your own. You can do this with `git pull origin your-branch-name`.
