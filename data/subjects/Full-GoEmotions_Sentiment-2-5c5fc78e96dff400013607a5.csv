A: Hey B, I couldn't help but notice you seem pretty calm despite all the pressure we're under. How do you manage to stay so composed?

B: Oh, thanks for noticing, A. It's not always easy, but I have this technique that really helps me. I focus on my breathing and take a few deep breaths whenever I start feeling overwhelmed. It helps me clear my mind and stay focused.

A: That sounds interesting. Taking deep, measured breaths usually helps me regain my composure  Do you have any specific breathing exercises you follow, or is it just about taking deep breaths?

A: I was going through the project requirements and noticed something about the data validation rules. Can you clarify if there's a specific format we need to follow for the input data?

A: I'm curious about how the grading system works here. Can you explain how you assess the students' performance?

B: Of course! We use a combination of formative and summative assessments. Formative assessments include quizzes, class participation, and homework, which help us gauge ongoing understanding. Summative assessments, like end-of-term exams and projects, evaluate the students' overall grasp of the material.
