A: Hey B, I've been thinking about the situation with Alex. Given the recent improvements and the feedback we've received, I believe the block we placed on his project access might no longer be necessary. What are your thoughts on lifting it?

A: Got it, thanks! I hope I don't upset anyone by jumping in univited, but why are self-created images any different than those found elsewhere so long as they comply with all of the non-free content criteria? Is this caveat hiding in a talk page archive somewhere? So, if I create an image myself, do I need to add any specific tags or information when uploading it?

B: Yes, when you upload a self-created image, you should tag it as ""self-created"" and include a brief description. It's also good practice to mention that you are the author and specify the license under which you're releasing it.","I hope I don't upset anyone by jumping in univited, but why are self-created images any different than those found elsewhere so long as they comply with all of the non-free content criteria?

A: Hi B, do you have a moment to chat? Interrobang mentioned that you might benefit from some mentorship while they're away, and I wanted to see if you'd be comfortable with me stepping in to help.
