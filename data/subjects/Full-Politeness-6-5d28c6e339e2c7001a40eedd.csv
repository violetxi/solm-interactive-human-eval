B: Sure, A! Basically, an IP address is like a digital address for a device on a network.

A: Hi B, I hope you're doing well. I'm new to the process of nominating articles for deletion on Wikipedia and I want to make sure I do it correctly. Hi, Wereon - I'm afraid I'm rather amateur at nominating articles for deletion. Where do I start? Could you please guide me through the steps?

B: Hi A, I'm happy to help! The first thing you need to do is ensure that the article meets the criteria for deletion. Once you're sure, you can start by adding a deletion tag to the top of the article. After that, you'll need to create a deletion discussion page and notify the article's creator. Would you like more details on any of these steps?

Turn 2
A: Thank you, B! That makes sense. I think I understand the tagging part, but I'm a bit unsure about how to create the deletion discussion page. Could you walk me through that?

B: Of course! After tagging the article, go to the Articles for Deletion (AfD) page and click on the ""Nominate for deletion"" link. You'll be prompted to fill out a form with the article's name and your reasons for deletion. Once you submit it, a discussion page will be created automatically. Don't forget to notify the article's creator by leaving a message on their talk page.

A: Hi B, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in and see if you have some time this week to continue our discussion on the Legacy section with Direktor. I think we made good progress last time and it would be great to keep the momentum going.

B: Hi A, I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I agree, it would be good to keep things moving. I have some availability on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. Does either of those times work for you?
